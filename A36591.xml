            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>IT is an Ancient and well approved Maxim among the Learned, that the more truth is winnowed and ſifted, the more oppoſed and contended againſt, the more tranſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent and illuſtrious it appears. <hi>Veritas ventilata plus rutilat &amp; impugnata magis eluceſit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A further confirmation whereof you may meet with, from the late oppoſition Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> hath made againſt the <hi>truth,</hi> in his late Book called <hi>Infants Baptiſme atteſted and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated by Scripture and Antiquity, in an Anſwer to a treatiſe, by Mr. H.D.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Wherein notwithſtanding the dilligent ſearch, he tells us, he has made in the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſity Library at <hi>Oxford,</hi> the utmoſt aſſiſtance that all the learned writers Mr. <hi>Marſhall, Baxter, Cobbet, Cotten, Holmes,</hi> &amp;c. can give him to diſprove and weaken the Authorities urged from Scripture and Antiquity for Believers againſt <hi>Infants Baptiſme,</hi> ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> you'l finde they ſerve but ſo much the more to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> that <hi>truth</hi> he pretends to <hi>foil,</hi> giving only an opportunity for further confirmation and ratification, and to create more full ſatisfaction or conviction to any that have been in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, as to the truth of any of thoſe <hi>Authorities</hi> urged by me. Wherein notwithſtanding his great flouriſh and noyſe you'l finde he is not able to reprove the truth ſo much as of
<pb facs="tcp:97512:3"/> one of thoſe many Authorities in the Hiſtorical part, and excepting that one in the Doctrinal part, <hi>viz. Calvin</hi> for <hi>Eckius,</hi> not another that is conſiderable in the whole Book.</p>
            <p>Therefore all that I have to <hi>ask</hi> of the <hi>Candid Reader</hi> (at whoſe Barr the matter is now br<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ught betwixt Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> and me) is only to do themſelves and the truth in Queſtion ſo much right as to afford the Common Juſtice of an open Ear; that having heard the Recrimination, they will alſo attend to what is ſaid herein for vindication.</p>
            <p>Wherein y u have his Arguments duely weighed, and refuted, his caviling exceptions anſwer'd; his pretended forgeries, and falſhoods, diſproved; the Antiquities of Believers Baptiſme defended; the innovation, groundleſs Tradition, and novelty of Infants Baptiſme confirmed. The witneſs againſt it by eminent men and famous Churches for many Ages maintained; his injurious Calumnyes and reproaches (that he not only deſignes to load the Profeſſors of believers Baptiſme with, but the Profeſſion it ſelf alſo) detected and reproved, The groundleſs cuſtome of <hi>ſprinkling</hi> inſtead of <hi>Dipping</hi> further evinced.</p>
            <p>As for his undue and uncomly reflections, the haughty, bitter wrathfull, frothy and provoking ſpirit, he appears in, through the whole Book, ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n for ſuch hard ſpeeches for his names ſake; and rather ſo farr as concerns my ſelf with <hi>Job,</hi> to binde it about me for a Crown, <hi>Job. 31.36.</hi> And as exhorted <hi>Mat. 5. To rejoyce to be accounted wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſuffer contempt &amp; reproach for the truth ſake,</hi> &amp;c. then to render Railing for Railing. It being alſo ever judged the ſigne of a bad cauſe, for perſons to betake them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſuch courſes, and thereby to ſupply the want of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb facs="tcp:97512:3"/> and ſound Argument with rage, clamour and noyſe.</p>
            <p>The Scripture arguments 'tis true I have little medled with, and that for theſe following reaſons.</p>
            <p>Firſt, becauſe the Hiſtorical part upon which ſo much ſtreſs hath been laid (though the leaneſt part of the controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy) was the principal new thing added by me (it being as Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> obſerves, next to an impoſſibility to offer any new Scripture, or almoſt any new Argument that hath not been before urged in the controverſy;) and is mainly there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by him oppoſed.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe he has <hi>ingeniouſly</hi> confeſs'd, that there is no expreſs Scripture f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r the ſame; And ſo many of themſelves with one Mouth have owned, the <hi>neceſſity of expreſs Scripture to warrant and juſtify the practiſe of every part of Gods worſhip, and that to practiſe any thing in the worſhip of God without expreſs warranty from the Word, is ſuperſtition and falſe worſhip.</hi> And that <hi>ſuch a Principle ought to be held faſt as the great Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Bulwark to ſecure us againſt all Popiſh Innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Traditions: and</hi> which is a ſufficient anſwer out of their own Mouthes againſt any thing they urge from pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended inferences and farr-fetch't <hi>Conſequences,</hi> being all that can poſſibly be ſaid for it.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, becauſe <hi>M. Tombes</hi> hath now given a particular Anſwer to him and Mr. <hi>Blinman</hi> therein, who being none of thoſe rigid <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> that Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> expreſſeth ſo much enmity againſt, his Arguments may be more acceptable to him.</p>
            <p>And <hi>4ly.</hi> becauſe I intend to do it more particularly here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, (if God pleaſe) by it ſelf, having yet much to reckon with Mr. <hi>Will's</hi> for his further abuſes, and grand miſtakes in the Doctrinal part.</p>
            <p>In the next place, it is very obſervable, and I deſire the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to take ſpecial notice of it, that the things he would ſo
<pb facs="tcp:97512:4"/> injuriouſly Father upon me he is himſelf found fouly guilty of; making good <hi>Prov. 26.27.</hi> and of which I ſhall point you to a few inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Firſt, that the forgeries and prevarications he charges up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me, do all return upon himſelf; and not one of them made good againſt me, as appears from <hi>l. 1.</hi> to <hi>p. 29.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, that the ſeveral falſhoods he lays to my charge are all of them of his own making and not one of them to be proved againſt me, as is particularly evidenced from <hi>p. 29.</hi> to <hi>p. 62.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, the notorious abuſe he has put upon Authors by forgery, curtilations<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> mis-quotation, mis-tranſlation, and which fully appears by the following inſtances, <hi>viz.</hi>

            <p>As for my <hi>Epitomizing</hi> and repeating ſome of Mr <hi>Tombes s</hi> Arguments, and not alwayes mentioning his name, which he calls <hi>Plaigiariſme,</hi> I do confeſs in that my colle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, I have not ſo punctually mentioned all our own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from Book to book, wherein (except in the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rical part) I do little more then bring to remembrance, in a new Method (for the benefit of the preſent age) what has heretofore in large Treatiſes been writ upon this ſubject, which I think is uſual in Polemical writings, &amp; if I miſtake not, Mr <hi>Sydnham</hi> doth the ſame thing without mentioning of names, from whom the arguments are brought (which may be endleſs;) And if I have been thereby injurious to any I beg their pardon; I am ſure I have not been ſo to the truth; But herein I conceive Mr <hi>Will's</hi> hath not dealt fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, 1ſt to reprove me for the ſame thing he doth himſelf, for I could draw paralells too upon him if I would be troubleſome and impertinent; and 2ly to avoid anſwering the force of the Arguments, upon pretence they are anothers not my own, which I conceive ſavours little of ingenuity and will ſcarſe go for current pay.</p>
            <p>It is true, it muſt be owned that Mr <hi>Tombes</hi> how much ſoever ſlighted by <hi>M. Will's</hi> (though in ſome things very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from moſt that own this way) hath done very worthily in this controverſy, &amp; was an eminent inſtrument that God rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed up amongst the learned to plead and defend that deſpiſed truth, &amp; whoſe learned labours and unanſwered Books do wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for him in the <hi>gate,</hi> though <hi>M. Will's</hi> is pleaſed ſo igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantly to vaunt it, &amp; tell us in his Epiſtle, that the Arguments for <hi>believers againſt</hi> Infants Baptiſme <hi>are a parcel of Trite
<pb facs="tcp:97512:6"/> overworn things, a nauſeous crambe or repitition</hi> of old <hi>routed Arguments, that had been in effect trampled upon and confuted again and again,</hi> though his Anti-paedobaptiſm in <hi>3</hi> parts, containing neer as I judge <hi>1500.</hi> pages in quarto, replying to what had been written by above <hi>20</hi> ſeveral perſons are all of them, if I am not miſinformed unreplied to to this day</p>
            <p>And further, I muſt inform the Reader that had any modeſt endeavours prevailed, theſe things had more privately (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this troubleing the world) been rectifyd between Mr <hi>Will's</hi> and me, But he having as he tells us received from the learned his <hi>Album calculum,</hi> or approbation, would not by any means be ſtopt in his career for the ſuppoſed victory and glory; And how far he has merrited that high <hi>Encomium</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by his <hi>Imprimatur, M. B.</hi> in his Epiſtle Recommendatory is to be conſidered, who tells us, <hi>that much thanks is due to him the reverend Author from the Church</hi> for <hi>anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my Arguments ſatisfactorily, and by ſearching into, &amp; ſo fully confuting all my pretended antiquities, thereby defending</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>Gods truth &amp; the Churches right, whilſt other of his bretheren by ignorance and ſloth, trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherous ſilence or ſilly unſatisfactory. Arguings, have betrayd the cauſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whether inſtead of the Churches thanks they ought not both (in Mr <hi>B's</hi> own language) to have the Church told of them, for peſtering the world with ſuch impertinencyes, one for his heedleſs writing of them, and the other for his raſh and careleſs Commendation, is ſubmitted to judgment.</p>
            <p>And laſtly, Whether it is not now demonſtrably evident to all men that will impartially conſider, that notwithſtanding the confident vain-glorious boaſt of theſe great undertakers, that till better proof be manifeſted there as yet appears as little Antiquity for Infants Sprinkling in the firſt Ages, as (they themſelves acknowledge) expreſs ſcripture for the ſame.</p>

               <p>So that all our inſtances from the ſayings of our <hi>Eminent</hi> Men, ſtands as yet firme for us, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> has ſaid to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Secondly, as to the <hi>Decrees</hi> of the three <hi>Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels,</hi> he ſaith this: <hi>That if it muſt go by the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Councels, they ſhall carry it; for if I name three, that muſt be ſuppoſed to be againſt Infants Baptiſme, he thinks he ſhould not exceed, if he ſaid, he could name ten times three for it.</hi> Beſides he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives, that <hi>theſe three Councels mentioned by me, had reſpect only to Pagans, in thoſe their Decrees, from what Mr.</hi> Marſhall <hi>had ſaid in anſwer to that of Neocaeſaria.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>

But what are ſuch <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees</hi> to this <hi>fourth Century,</hi> wherein I produce three for Believers Baptiſme, upon <hi>Profeſſion</hi> and <hi>free choice;</hi> and he not one in this time (as indeed it is impoſſible he ſhould) there being none found to ordain any <hi>ſuch thing,</hi> till after this Century.</p>
               <p>And as to his conception, that the <hi>Neocaeſarian</hi> Councel means <hi>only Pagans,</hi> and not the <hi>Children</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Women, as he ſaith. Mr.</hi> Marſhal <hi>hath made appear; and therefore in his uſuall civility tells

               </p>
               <p>He muſt therefore know, that he and <hi>Mr. Marſhal,</hi> both do miſs the Caſe, the ſtreſs of the Decree lyes not about the Parent, but for the Excluſion of all Children, whether of <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Parents; becauſe confeſſion, and free choice is required in that Sacrament. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith <hi>Grotius</hi> from the <hi>Gloſſers, That an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant cannot be Baptiſed, becauſe it hath no power to confeſs, or chooſe the Divine Baptiſme.</hi> And which <hi>ſpeaks reaſon, ſaith Doctor</hi> Tayler, <hi>and intimates a practice which was abſolutely univerſal in the Church, of interrogating the Catechumens, concerning the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of their Creed, which is one Argument ſaith he, that either they did not admit Infants to Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, or that they did praevaricate egregiouſly, in asking Queſtions of them, who themſelves know, were uncapable of giving anſwers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that we have as little <hi>prevaricated</hi> in our <hi>Councels,</hi> as in our <hi>Fathers.</hi>

And in his Exhortation to Baptiſme, that none were to be baptiſed but the Catechumens, and
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:97512:28"/> thoſe that were duly inſtructed in the Faith.</hi> Upon which he ſaith, <hi>Now this is ſufficient to impoſe a fallacy upon any Reader, that hath no <hi>Aquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> with that Father, and underſtand not in what ſence he ſpeaks, who would not think that this Ancient Doctor was againſt Infants Baptiſme, and that no ſuch thing was owned in the Church in his dayes?</hi> [very true, and ſo one would indeed, for if <hi>Faith muſt go before, and Children have no Faith,</hi> then only profeſſed Believers were the Subjects.] And again, if <hi>None <hi>but the Catechu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens, and thoſe inſtructed in the Faith were to be Baptiſed,</hi>
                     </hi> then ſurely no Children were to be Baptiſed, who were ſo uncapable, both of the one, and the other; Therefore by the way it muſt be <hi>granted,</hi> that this was a <hi>proper proof,</hi> to evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that the <hi>Eaſtern Church</hi> in his time ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted only of <hi>Adult Baptiſme,</hi> which he is pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſay, is ſo <hi>abominably falſe.</hi>

It is true, the words I find <hi>exactly</hi> to be the words of <hi>Gregory Nazienzen,</hi> but not of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zil,</hi> as Cent. 4. cap. 4. p. 234. <hi>Oratione in ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctum Lavacrum tertia: Quid de Infantibus ais qui neque gratia, quid ne ſit paena cognorunt, nam &amp; illos baptizemus?

                  </p>
                  <p>But ſuppoſe there had been ſuch a <hi>Sentence,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> ſaith <hi>followeth,</hi> I had cited enough of the Father, to <hi>confirm</hi> the truth of what I <hi>aſſerted, viz.</hi> that <hi>inſtruction</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> according to Chriſts <hi>Commiſſion,</hi> was neceſſary to precede Baptiſme; And that none but the Adult, that made Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of <hi>Faith,</hi> were to be <hi>baptiſed:</hi> And if he ſhould have contradicted himſelf, as ſome others had done, it would have been their <hi>parts</hi> that ſhould avouch <hi>him,</hi> in the behalf of Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, to have reconciled ſuch a contradiction, to thoſe his former <hi>aſſertions.</hi>

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> tells us, that though theſe are forgeries,<note place="margin">Juſtin Martyr to Triphon examined.</note> yet <hi>Justin</hi> Martyrs Dialogue to <hi>Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phon,</hi> is <hi>genuine, who therein ſaith, that it was lawful for all to receive the Spiritual Circumciſion, [viz.</hi> Baptiſme] <hi>whereby it may well be inferred, ſaith Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>from Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>that if all may receive it, then Infants, who were the Subjects of Legal Circumciſion, for they muſt be part of all, and not excluded,</hi> Wills 128.</p>
                  <p>Which I ſay, is a meer <hi>impertinency,</hi> and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>For firſt, here is not one word of <hi>Infants,</hi> nor of Infants Baptiſme, or its Apoſtolicalneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, it is very <hi>abſurd</hi> (the better to hook in Children) to interprete the word <hi>[all]</hi> to be all Men; for if all Men, then it muſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend wicked, as well as good; Believers, as well as Unbelievers; and which (<hi>as confined to Baptiſme,</hi> by Maſter <hi>Wills</hi>) is to contradict Chriſts Commiſſion, and the Apoſtles practiſe, who limited it only to thoſe, that repented of their Sins, and believed the Goſpel. And though it is true, the Goſpel was to be preached to all, and all of all Nations, in diſtinction to the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Jews, who only were concerned in the firſt Commiſſion; yet only they taught <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi> amongſt them, were to be <hi>Baptiſed;</hi> not the ignorant, and <hi>prophane;</hi> And if the word <hi>All,</hi> be ſo to be underſtood, it is a witneſs <hi>for us,</hi> not them, for Infants thereby are excluded, who
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:97512:46"/> are neither capable of Inſtruction, Repentance, or Faith. And that it is ſo to be underſtood, let <hi>Juſtin</hi> himſelf be the <hi>Interpreter,</hi> who not only in his <hi>Apology,</hi> before mentioned, tells us,<note place="margin">Juſtin himſelf contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts Mr. Wills ſenſe</note> that they <hi>Only,</hi> who <hi>were inſtructed in the Faith, and believed, were brought to Baptiſme, to have their new Birth perfected.</hi> But in this <hi>uery Dialogue to Tryphon,</hi> tells us, <hi>that by the Word, and Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me, Regeneration was <hi>perfected,</hi> in all man kind, (viz.</hi> in all that did hear, and receive the word, and were capable to come to Baptiſme.) <hi>And again, that by the grace of God, and the Baptiſme of Repentance, ſins were expiated,</hi> as Magdeburgs Cent. 2. pag. 4. 7. <hi>which ſufficiently declares, that this is nothing to the purpoſe, except it be to confirm Believers Baptiſme only.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And to which ſaith Mr. <hi>Tombes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mr. Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Notion.</note> This <hi>teſtimony for Antiquity of Infants Baptiſme, I remember not alledged by any before Mr.</hi> Baxter, <hi>and therefore, beſides the impertinency of the words, as he himſelf alledgeth them, I ſee no need to ſearch further into it,</hi> Review 2. part p. 71.</p>
                  <p>In the next place Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> tells us of an other Antiquity, to prove Infants Baptiſme <hi>Apoſtolical,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iraeneus teſtimony examined.</note> viz. <hi>Iraeneus,</hi> who in Lib. 2. c. 39. Adverſ.

All I ſay, who by him are born again to God:</hi> Whereby (<hi>ſaith Mr.</hi> Wills) <hi>we infer, that being born again to God, ſignifying Baptiſme, as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients for the moſt part took it, then were the Infants baptiſed in his day,</hi> Wills p. 129.</p>
                  <p>To which I reply, that if this be any more to
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:97512:47"/> the purpoſe then the former, let all Men <hi>judge;</hi> and whether it be not far <hi>fetch'd,</hi> and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raly <hi>ſcrewed,</hi> without either Reaſon, or truth?</p>

                     <note place="margin">Very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent.</note>For firſt, here is not one word of <hi>Infants Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme,</hi> or its <hi>Apoſtolicalneſs,</hi> and nothing but an <hi>impertinent</hi> begging <hi>Queſtion</hi> upon <hi>Question,</hi> to make up an <hi>inference.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, The Interpretation upon which it is founded, is wholy <hi>falacious,</hi> for neither the <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> nor <hi>Justin Martyr,</hi> do call Baptiſme <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation</hi> abſolutely, but only as it is the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bole of <hi>Regeneration,</hi> already wrought by the word, and ſo <hi>Juſtins</hi> words <hi>b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

To which Mr. <hi>Tombes</hi> has ſo well anſwered Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> in his third Review, pag. 79. (And which was never yet replyed to) that we need ſay no <hi>more</hi> to it, <hi>viz.</hi>

                        <hi>Becauſe Mr.</hi> Fox <hi>tells us, out of</hi> Bede, and Fabian, and others, that they refuſed to bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe after the manner of <hi>Rome,</hi> which Fabian as I find, more particularly explains, to be in the point of Infants Baptiſme; and in confirmation thereof gave five Arguments. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Becauſe they kept themſelves, both in Diſcipline, and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, ſo ezpreſly to the Scripture, (there being no expreſs Scripture for Infants Baptiſme, as confeſt on all hands.) <hi>Secondly; Becauſe</hi> they were ſuch zealous impugners of Tradition, that being as <hi>Auſtin</hi> confeſſeth, the only Divine Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity for it. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Becauſe <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> the Son of Chriſtian Parents, was not baptiſed in this Iſland in his Infancy. <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Becauſe their cuſtom was to baptiſe after Confeſſion of Faith, being in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion, and Communion therein with the French Chriſtians, whereof Inſtances are given. <hi>Fifthly,</hi> From the Queſtion that was here put to <hi>Auſtin; viz.</hi> how long a Child, that was no in danger of death, might ſtay unbaptiſed?</q> 
                     <hi>which he could not reſolve, till he ſent to</hi> Rome <hi>for the Solution. And to which me may add, what</hi> the Magdeburgs tell us from <hi>Hilaries</hi> teſtimony, p. 55. <hi>that none but the Adult were baptiſed, in the Weſtern Churches, in his time.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">VVhy the Commo<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tions in Swevia not Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtical.</note>Firſt, that the <hi>Commotions in Swevia</hi> 1635. were not <hi>Anabaptiſtical</hi> appears by their twelve demands, which you have mentioned at large by <hi>Oſiander</hi> Cent. 16. c. 36, p. 100. <hi>Wherein is not one word ſavouring</hi> of <hi>Anabaptiſm, but about freedom from Exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to deliver themſelves from the Tyranny (as they ſay) of their Princes and Biſhops more Helvetiorum</hi> (which <hi>Gnedolius</hi> alſo informs us, as I before mentioned) being much of the ſame nature with thoſe other <hi>Demands</hi> made by the <hi>Ruſticks</hi> twenty three Years before (which was the Year after the Revolt of <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Schafhuiſen</hi>) of which you have alſo an account in <hi>Oſiander Cent.</hi> 16. <hi>L.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 6. <hi>p.</hi> 10. And that theſe commoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were not <hi>fomented</hi> and principally <hi>mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged</hi> by the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> may appear; Firſt from thoſe firſt <hi>Demands,</hi> which were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally made and managed by the <hi>Papiſts;</hi> as <hi>Oſiander</hi> and <hi>Biſhop Jewel</hi> againſt <hi>Harding</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:97512:79"/> inform, and the Articles themſelves expreſs; and that the Latter Demands in 1625. were principally carried on by the <hi>Lutherans,</hi> (though it is true <hi>Luther</hi> afterwards Writ againſt them) as <hi>Oſiander</hi> tells us. In <hi>which attempt alſo that Year fell of them</hi> (as <hi>Paget</hi> in his <hi>Heriſography informs</hi> us) <hi>one hundred and fifty thouſand:</hi> the hundred part whereof could not be <hi>Anabaptiſts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To the ſecond he tells us <hi>it is both odious and injurious, to compare thoſe attempts of</hi> Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va <hi>and the</hi> Switzers <hi>with thoſe in</hi> Swevia, <hi>when none, as he ſaith, can be ſuch Diaboli as to charge the</hi> Switzers <hi>with Robbing the Nobility, Plundring of Towns, and Caſtles, Rifling of all that was Sacred, as thoſe</hi> Germans <hi>did.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which I ſay,<note place="margin">VVhy the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions not odious as charged.</note> that the Chronicles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves can beſt inform how thoſe <hi>Cantons</hi> formerly, and thoſe of <hi>Baſil Schafhuſen</hi> and <hi>Geneva</hi> ſince did manage their <hi>Confederacies,</hi> ſurprize their <hi>Towns</hi> and <hi>Caſtles,</hi> diſpoſeſs their <hi>Princes,</hi> and <hi>Biſhops;</hi> and poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of their <hi>Revenues</hi> Civil and Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal. For my part I am yet to learn (from what ever I read) where the difference lay in the attempts, only that thoſe Cantons had better Conduct and <hi>proſpered,</hi> and the other had neither <hi>Conduct</hi> nor <hi>Succeſs,</hi> but miſcarri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in both; which if the other had done, as much <hi>obloque</hi> might have befallen them. And you'l find ſome <hi>Protestant</hi> Writers as well as <hi>Popiſh</hi> to charge as much <hi>iregularity</hi> on the undertaking of the <hi>one,</hi> as of the <hi>other;</hi>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:97512:80"/> who will tell you that the <hi>Boores</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> and they of <hi>Munſter,</hi> might as warrantably turn out their <hi>Princes, Biſhops,</hi> and <hi>Canons;</hi> and poſeſs themſelves of their <hi>Revenues,</hi> as <hi>Geneva,</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Helvetia</hi> had done. And we are not ignorant of the ſeveral at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that the City of <hi>Munſter</hi> hath made within a few years, ſince wholly <hi>Popiſh,</hi> to deliver themſelves from the <hi>Exactions</hi> of their <hi>Biſhop,</hi> which by the <hi>Biſhop</hi> hath been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed no leſs ſeditious and <hi>rebellious,</hi> than the former.</p>
               <p>Thirdly as to the Originall of the Munſter commotion, though he grants the turning out of the Biſhops, Cannons, &amp;c. out of the Churches, and the City alſo, by the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts. <hi>Yet tells me, I ſpeak falſely in ſaying, that Spanhamius tells us that it came to Arms betwixt the Biſhops and City, who ſaith the quite contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and tells us (as he ſaith) that it never came to blows.</hi>

                     <hi>Mr. Wills</hi> very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial.</note>I ſay <hi>Spanhemius</hi> and <hi>Oſiander</hi> tells us, &amp;c.

<pb n="149" facs="tcp:97512:80"/> 
                  <hi>Spanhemius</hi> it is true ſpeaks very briefly of the difference and <hi>Agreement</hi> that happened be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and <hi>Senate</hi> thereupon, Though I muſt tell <hi>Mr. Wills it</hi> is his miſtake to ſay, that <hi>Spanhemius</hi> denies it came to Armies: for he ſaith no ſuch thing; But <hi>Oſiander</hi> from <hi>Sleyden</hi> goes to particulars: And tells us, how the <hi>Biſhop</hi> drew a Force down to a Neighbouring Village called <hi>Telgeto,</hi> ſtopt and ſtreightned them of proviſion (for ſo ſaith <hi>Sleiden</hi>) And ſent meſſengers to command the <hi>reſtoring</hi> of the <hi>Canons</hi> to their <hi>Churches</hi> again, and the turning out of Town the new <hi>Preachers:</hi> But how that inſtead thereof they detayned his <hi>Meſſengers,</hi> and ſent a party out of the <hi>Town</hi> in the <hi>Night</hi> and <hi>ſurprized</hi> and brought away Priſoners, diverſe of the <hi>Biſhops</hi> men; and that he himſelf had been taken alſo, if he had not gone out of his Quarters, that <hi>Night</hi> before. And if this could be done without Arms, and Blows, let all Men judge: and whether the reproof doth not more properly belong to <hi>Mr. Wills</hi> than my ſelf therein.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, As to the <hi>Suſpition</hi> (why I ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed there was cauſe to doubt) of the truth of thoſe monſterous Villanyes acted in their Communities in the Latter part of the Siege, as mentioned by their malitious enemies the <hi>Papiſts,</hi> and many of their inveterate enemies the <hi>Proteſtants, He ſaith it is extreamly ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous in two reſpects, Firſt for calling into Queſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion the matter of fact, eſpecially as reported by the Proteſtants, who were not</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97512:81"/> enemies, but very loving friends to them.</hi> And <hi>Secondly, For endeavouring to palliate ſuch horrid actings of the Anabaptiſts,</hi> a thing never done by any.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Why cauſe to ſuſpect ſome of the reports about <hi>Munſter.</hi>
                  </note>In anſwer whereto I ſay let it in the firſt place be remembred, that as to the firſt part of my ſuſpicion, why thoſe horrid enormities reported might be ſcandals, <hi>viz.</hi> From the reports given them by the lying <hi>Papiſts</hi> (who ſpeak as bad things of <hi>Calvin</hi> and <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> themſelves, and of the Waldenſes before them, as you have heard) he ſeems ſilently to own.<note place="margin">firſt from Papiſts.</note> But his great offence lies againſt me for <hi>queſtioning</hi> the truth of what is ſaid thereof by the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Writers ſuch as <hi>Sleiden, Oſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, Spanhemius, Zwinglius,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>who were</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>moſt faithful hiſtorians, grave Divines, and who gave punctuallly the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of time, place, opinions, &amp;c.

                  <hi>Sleiden.</hi> And as for <hi>Spanhemius</hi> he wrote not till eighty years after <hi>Sleiden.</hi> upon whom <hi>Mr. Wills</hi> lays the greateſt ſtreſs, and who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be a <hi>very partial</hi> and <hi>unfaithful writer</hi> reſpecting the <hi>Anabaptiſts</hi> in that his Hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Narration printed 1646.

That they were Manichaeans, Andians, Anthro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pomorphites, Trithcits, Samoſatenians, Noeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and Sabellians: Apollinariſts, and Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anites, Anaſtations, Neſtorians, Eutichians, Corinthians, Photinians, Oregenianss Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſts, Novatians, Donatiſts, Parmenians, Marcionites, Eunomians, Montaniſts, Nico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laites, Baſilidians, Cataphrigians, Gnosticks, Pelagians, and Socinians.</hi> All which Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he enlargeth upon, and applies to them, then which what could ſavour more of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bullition of a Malicious Spirit?</p>
               <p>And as for <hi>Zwinglius</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Zwinglius</hi> cruel E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy with the Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſts.</note> he could give no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his buſineſs, who dyed five years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, <hi>viz</hi> 1531. But as to this great friends<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (<hi>Mr. Wills</hi> boaſts of) <hi>By the gentleneſs and tenderneſs that he ſhewed to thoſe anabaptiſts, that fell off from his Church, whom he treated not as Enemies, but as his intimate friends</hi> (as he tells us) I ſhall give you ſome particular <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count,</hi> wherein you will find what is that

                  <hi>Kindneſs</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs,</hi> it ſeems we might expect from <hi>Mr. Wills</hi> if it was in his power.</p>
               <p>It is true at firſt <hi>Zwinglius</hi> was a great Friend and <hi>Companion</hi> of the <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> and a great favourer of their opinion in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to that of <hi>Infants Baptiſm,</hi> as <hi>Treat. Bapt.</hi> p 262.</p>
               <p>But afterwards who more <hi>Cruel</hi> amongſt the Bloody <hi>Papiſts</hi> themſelves than he, as you have a <hi>particular</hi> account from thoſe edicts of <hi>Zurick,</hi> wherein he had the principal hand, p. 260. And the <hi>Inhumane Execution</hi> of them by <hi>drowning, burning, and Starving.</hi> It is true to palliate this Cruelty, <hi>Mr. Wills</hi> tells us from <hi>Spanhemius,</hi> that they ſuffered not theſe ſeverities for being <hi>Anabaptiſts but as perju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, diſobedient and ſeditious perſons, which is</hi> a farther diſcovery of his malice and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fullneſs.</p>

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:97512:82"/> perſens within their Juriſdiction) was himſelf drowned in water upon 5th. Jan: Anno.</hi> 1527. And this was <hi>Zwinglius</hi> his Kindneſs to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timate Friends and Brethren (this Mentzius having been an ancient Diſciple and an Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent preacher) And much the like friendſhip they met with from their <hi>Proteſtant Friends</hi> at <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Schafhuiſen</hi> as you have it p. 256. And therefore it was no wonder, if they could be ſo <hi>prodigal of their lives</hi> that they ſhould be ſo <hi>laviſh</hi> of their <hi>Reputations;</hi> for the latter would only help to <hi>juſtifie</hi> the <hi>former:</hi> for juſt in like manner did the <hi>Papiſts</hi> deal with the <hi>Allegeois</hi> in Innocent the third his time, the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to cover over their murderous and bloody cruelties againſt them.</p>

               <p>But Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> his chief improvement of this Story is yet behind; Which is fitly, not only to render the Profeſſors them of vile and contemptible, but the <hi>Principle it ſelf</hi> cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt and <hi>deteſtable.</hi> And <hi>therefore in words at length tells us both from himſelf and others, that the Principle of Anabaptiſm is falſe and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; and a Principle of darkneſs: upon which many black Characters are Writ. And is not this to the purpoſe indeed? and beyond all that he hath ſaid? And therefore he might have ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved himſelf, the World, and me the trouble, of his great Book in detecting my miſtakes in Hyſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and the many falſhoods, that</hi> he <hi>pretends me guilty of, and the Refuting of my</hi> Arguments; But rather <hi>ſingly</hi> betook himſelf to this <hi>alone:</hi>

               <p>But let us hear what Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> ſayth to the point, which he tells us p. 100.

                  </note> that <hi>though Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>knew ſome good and ſober Men amongſt them; yet that the generality were bad enough: for ſo (ſays he) we muſt understand him in his plain proof p.</hi> 143. <hi>Where he tells us to this purpoſe; that he had familiarly known very many of them: And that the Miniſters were for the moſt part cenſori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinionatiſts, who deſigned to convert Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple more to their Judgements than to Chriſt: And that Anabaptiſtry had been the ordinary inlet to the moſt horrid opinion, and how negligent many are in Family Duties,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now therefore let all men judge, whether this amounts to any proof. What if Mr. <hi>Bax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> did know ſome of their Miniſters over Zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for their Opinion, and ſome of the people too remiſs; and negligent in their Duties to God? doth this prove the Immorality ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? and for his Apprehenſions, that it is the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let into horrid Opinions?

               <p>Only this I would adviſe <hi>Mr. Wills,</hi> that when he offers his next <hi>proof,</hi> he be more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular as to the Perſons and Crimes he charg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; as alſo, ſince he makes it ſo <hi>comprehenſive,</hi> to take in the Generality of the <hi>Baptiſts,</hi> and of ſo great moment as to judge their Principle by alſo, that the <hi>Blaſphemy</hi> and <hi>Immorality</hi> is ſuch as is <hi>foſter'd</hi> and <hi>borne with</hi> by the <hi>Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,</hi> otherwiſe they are no more chargable with ſuch <hi>Crimes,</hi> if they have caſt any ſuch wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Perſons</hi> out of them, then the Church of <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth</hi> was to be charged with Inceſt, though they had diſowned, and Excommunicated the Inceſtuous Perſon.</p>
               <p>And truly I think I may with much confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence challenge him, or any, the worſt of their Enemies, to produce any <hi>Blaſphemer,</hi> or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moral Perſon, ſo known to be, in any of the <hi>Churches</hi> of Chriſt under that Denomination.

                  </label> that notwithſtanding what he hath ſaid as to the <hi>Scandals</hi> attending it to prove it <hi>falſe;</hi> he ſeems now to make the proof of all to lye in this, <hi>that ſome Perſons holding the ſame refuſe Communion with Mr.</hi> Wills; and therefore all ſuch as ſo <hi>diſſent</hi> from him, are to be expoſed to <hi>ſcorn,</hi> and <hi>hatred,</hi> as ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>treacherous, diſobedient, perjured, ſeditious,</hi> filthy Perſons; for holding a <hi>falſe,</hi> and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous <hi>Principle.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The <hi>Principle of Anabaptiſtry it ſelf, as ſome Men hold it;</hi> By his own demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration he here makes the <hi>mode of holding;</hi> and that by <hi>ſome Men</hi> only, and not the <hi>Principle</hi> to be <hi>dangerous:</hi> for if it were the <hi>Principle</hi> it ſelf, it would then be contrary to all <hi>Principles,</hi> whether <hi>Natural, Moral,</hi> or <hi>Divine;</hi> and to its <hi>ſelf</hi> alſo: for Principles always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main the ſame in their own <hi>Nature,</hi> and receive not any ſuch <hi>impreſſion</hi> from the various conceptions of Men, as to vary in themſelves.</p>
               <p>If he had ſaid that the Principle does <hi>not justifie</hi> them that hold it moſt rigidly in an evil
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:97512:90"/> 
                  <hi>Opinion,</hi> or <hi>Practiſe,</hi> his demonſtration had been good: for I am ſo far from juſtifying the Errors of thoſe that hold either that <hi>O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion,</hi> or the Opinion that is <hi>contrary</hi> to it; that I fear, both Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> and my ſelf, have cauſe to <hi>ſearch,</hi> and to try our own <hi>ways;</hi> and to be humbled, for walking contrary to that <hi>Principle</hi> which we both own concerning Baptiſm.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> ſays <hi>it is the Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on of ſome, impregnated with this Principle, to rend the Church. And let Men conſider, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this be not an effect of Ignorance and Pride.</hi> Now then with Mr. <hi>Wills,</hi> it is neither the <hi>Principle</hi> it ſelf, nor the manner of holding it; but <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Pride:</hi> ſo that If I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand his way of <hi>arguing,</hi> either <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Pride,</hi> are all one with the Principle of <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſtry</hi> as terms <hi>convertible,</hi> or elſe the cauſe of <hi>unbrotherly</hi> diviſions, is not from the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple</hi> of Anabaptiſtry, but from <hi>Ignorance</hi> and <hi>Pride.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, if the Correſpondence and <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion which ſome Anabaptiſts have with Mr.</hi> Wills, <hi>be from their good Nature, and croſs to their Principles</hi> (as he declares it is) then it ſeems, that as <hi>Ignorance</hi> was before the ground of their <hi>rending</hi> from him, ſo here <hi>Ignorance</hi> is alſo the ground of their <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> with him; as not knowing that they therein croſs their own <hi>Principles,</hi> nor that they are any way <hi>obliged</hi> to that <hi>fellowſhip</hi> by the Word of God, only their good <hi>Nature</hi>
                  <pb n="159" facs="tcp:97512:90"/> inclines them not to break <hi>Company.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, as to what he quotes from Mr. <hi>Bunian,</hi> it had ſurely been more <hi>ingenuous,</hi> either to have reply'd himſelf to thoſe ſix <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments,</hi> as yet <hi>unanſwered,</hi> or provok'd Mr. <hi>Bunian</hi> to have done it before he had thus joined with him in his Anathama, for ſurely Reaſon is never <hi>convincingly</hi> anſwered by railing.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, I ſee not the Reaſon why Mr <hi>Wills,</hi> or any other <hi>Perſon,</hi> ſhould be thus ſevere againſt the Principles of <hi>Baptiſm,</hi> as proper only to <hi>penitent</hi> and <hi>believing Perſons,</hi> (for if he mean any thing elſe by the <hi>Principle</hi> of <hi>Anabaptiſtry</hi> he fights with his own <hi>ſhadow,</hi> we being as much againſt <hi>Rebaptiſation,</hi> as any that oppoſe it) for there is nothing in the Principle it ſelf, but what <hi>inclines</hi> to <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity;</hi> it being deſigned by Chriſt, not only to promote <hi>Sanctification,</hi> Rom. 6.4, 5, 6. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But to farther Love and Peace, as <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.3, 4, 5. being the <hi>incorporating</hi> knitting <hi>Ordinance.</hi> Yet no Man that ever I have heard of, ever did, or can <hi>pretend,</hi> that this <hi>Principle</hi> perfects grace, and <hi>knowledge;</hi> and therefore now (as of old amongſt the pureſt Churches) are <hi>weakneſſes, diviſions,</hi> errors, and evils, found <hi>amongſt us;</hi> and ſo muſt it be <hi>expected,</hi> ſo long as an <hi>evil heart</hi> and <hi>envious Devil</hi> remains: yet withall do we own <hi>ſubjection</hi> to a <hi>holy</hi> and perfect <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Directory,</hi> to Correct and <hi>Rectifie,</hi> all er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roes and evil that may <hi>ariſe.</hi>

               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:97512:91"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But if Baptiſm be eſteemed a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Inlet into the <hi>Viſible Church,</hi> and that you can own <hi>Church Fellowſhip with none but Baptiſed Perſons,</hi> is not that a Dividing <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, it tends to divide betwixt World and Church, but not otherwiſe; and is no other than all that own the Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, whether <hi>Papiſts, Proteſtants Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian</hi> and <hi>Independents</hi> acknowledge, Baptiſm being alſo owned by the <hi>Antients</hi> to be <hi>Janua Sacramentorum;</hi> and ſo poſitive is Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> for it, that he tells us in expreſs terms, that they muſt deny the <hi>Scripture</hi> that deny it: his words are theſe in his place Scripture, <hi>p.</hi> 24. <hi>I know not what in ſhew of Reaſon can be ſaid to this by thoſe that renounce not Scripture; for what man dare go in a way that hath neither Precept nor Example to warrant it, from a way that hath a full current of both? Yet they that will admit Members into the Church without Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, do ſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that till Infants Sprinkling be proved Chriſts Ordinance of Baptiſm, <hi>Poedobaptiſts</hi> (by their own acknowledgment) are not to be eſteemed <hi>Viſible</hi> Members of the Church of Chriſt, having never had an orderly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion therein.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> But is not much <hi>Ingury</hi> hereby <hi>offered to Chriſt, thus to contract and narrow his Intereſt in ſuch a manner?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> It is true, it is ſo ſaid by Mr. <hi>Wills;</hi> But this is no other than <hi>Reformation</hi> in all
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:97512:91"/> Ages <hi>(ſince the Antechriſtian Defection)</hi> hath been <hi>charged with,</hi> and particularly that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation</hi> that has been endeavoured in that other <hi>Ordinance</hi> of the Lords Supper: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do the <hi>Presbyterians</hi> cry out againſt the <hi>Independants</hi> for <hi>ſinful Schiſm,</hi> as being <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menters of Faction,</hi> and for narrowing of Chriſts <hi>Intereſt</hi> in their reſpective <hi>Seperations</hi> and Church Communions: to the ſhame and ſcandol of the Chriſtian Religion: the ſame do the <hi>Prelates</hi> ſay to the <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and the very ſame do the <hi>Papiſts</hi> ſay to the <hi>Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coparians</hi> alſo. But Wiſdom is juſtified of her Children.</p>
               <p>Thus have we acquit our Principle and Practice from Mr. <hi>Wills</hi> his Falſe, Unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, and Injurious Calumnies he has caſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us. And ſhall recommend it to the Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers conſideration, whether he hath not by this unreaſonable (not to ſay malicious) carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age towards us, witneſſed too much affinity, with that ſlanderous Libell, called <hi>Baxter Baptized in Blood:</hi> that was the firſt Anſwer to the Treatiſe of Baptiſm; and which by Publick Authority was Renounced, and decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red ſcandalous malicious.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>AS to your Eſſay which came to my hands when I was buſily engaged with</hi> Mr. Wills, <hi>I have at laſt got ſo much</hi> time <hi>to ſay theſe few</hi> things <hi>to it,</hi> Viz.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>As to the</hi> Stile <hi>and</hi> Language, <hi>I muſt needs acknowledge (if compared with</hi> M. Wills) <hi>to be Sober and Chriſtian, though not without your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Reflections.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>As to the</hi> Subſtance <hi>of what you write, I make this brief Reply.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>So far as you have concerned your ſelf in the</hi> Hiſtorical <hi>and</hi> Ritual parts, <hi>this to</hi> Mr. W. <hi>may be a</hi> ſufficient <hi>Anſwer.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. <hi>To the main deſign of your Book,</hi> viz. <hi>The parity you make betwixt</hi> Infants Baptiſm, <hi>and</hi> Womens Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the Lords Supper, <hi>wherein you ſuppoſe you have gain'd ſo much advantage as to put an end to the Contraverſie, I return as followeth:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>'Tis confeſt I ſaid indeed ſhew but as good</hi> Example <hi>and</hi> Command <hi>for</hi> Infant Baptiſm, <hi>as we do for</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Receiving <hi>the</hi> Lords Supper, <hi>and it ſhall ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice; Which, notwithſtanding your great</hi> confidence, <hi>I ſee not in the leaſt made</hi> good, <hi>but the contrary alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; and, which I doubt not, is hereby manifest to you and all men.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt therefore, as to the</hi> Example <hi>urged by me, from</hi> Act. 1.14. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2.42, 44. viz. <hi>That</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>and the Women, were of the number of the</hi> 120 <hi>Diſciples, and who did break bread with the</hi> 3000 <hi>that were added to them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which you give the following Exceptions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That is it not expreſly ſaid, that the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were Believers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Neither in this place is</hi> Peter, <hi>and the reſt of the Apoſtles expreſly ſo called, but they are called</hi> Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, <hi>and ſo are the Women, being of the number of the</hi> 120, verſ. 15. <hi>And if any doubt, Whether</hi> Mary <hi>the Mother of</hi> Jeſus, Was a Believer, <hi>It will by as good Evidence appear as that the Twelve were ſo; For, ſo teſtifyeth the</hi> Angel, Luk. 1.18. Elizabeth, <hi>v.</hi> 45. <hi>and her own triumphant</hi> Faith, <hi>v.</hi> 46 to 56. <hi>And that</hi> the Women, <hi>her Companions, were ſo alſo, there is little ground to doubt, when it is conſidered who they were, viz.</hi> Mary Magdal. Mary the Wife of Cleo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas, Joanna and Salom, <hi>&amp;c. Who came</hi> with Chriſt <hi>out of</hi> Galilee, <hi>and eminently</hi> adminiſtred to him, followed <hi>him to his</hi> Croſs, <hi>to the</hi> Sepulchre, annoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>his Body,</hi> witneſſed <hi>to his Reſurrection, and to whom he gave Direction, with the reſt of his</hi> Diſciples <hi>at his</hi> Aſcention, <hi>to wait at</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>for the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> Spirit, Mat. 27.55, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mar. 16.19.

            <p>
               <hi>Another</hi> Exception <hi>is, That</hi> There is no menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that theſe women were in the great Aſſembly in the ſecond of the <hi>Acts:</hi> For, How do you know but they might be dead, or ſick, or abſent, as <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> was before, <hi>Joh.</hi> 20.24. as nothing expreſt to the contrary, ſo nothing expreſly affirmed that they were preſent, <hi>pag.</hi> 3.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>This is very ſtrange; For is it not expreſly ſaid, (as one continued diſcourſe) by</hi> Luke, chap 2.1. <hi>That they were all upon the day of</hi> Penticoſt, with one accord in one place: <hi>And who could theſe <hi>All</hi> be that were thus aſſembled, but the</hi> 120 Diſciples <hi>before mentioned, who had been waiting together by Chriſts appointment for the promiſed Spirit, the ſpace of ten dayes ſince the Aſcention; and who were now to</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive an Anſwer, <hi>none therefore being to be</hi> abſent. <hi>And that the Women were</hi> preſent <hi>among them upon the pouring out of the Spirit is manifeſt, becauſe</hi> Peter <hi>thereupon affirms,</hi> That the Propheſie of <hi>Joel</hi> was then fulfilled, that foretold the powring out of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> upon the <hi>Daughters</hi> and <hi>Hand-maids,</hi> as well as the <hi>Sons,</hi> Act. 2.16, 17.</p>

               <hi>And as your own Conſcience ſeals to the truth here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, ſo you are force alſo to declare it, telling us,</hi> How unpleaſing it is to you, to raiſe Arguments againſt a known Truth, being, <hi>as you ſay,</hi> as much for Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving womens receiving the Lords Supper as the men</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thus have you my</hi> Proofs <hi>for</hi> Womens receiving the Lords Supper, <hi>and the</hi> Verity <hi>thereof</hi> confirmed by your ſelf: <hi>Therefore in the next place we ſhall try whether you have,</hi> as clear, <hi>or, as you ſay,</hi> more full proof <hi>for the</hi> Example <hi>of</hi> Infants Baptiſm, <hi>and as to which, you give the following</hi> Inſtances. <hi>Viz.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> That <hi>Lydia</hi> was Baptized and her Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.15. It is not ſaid that any of her Houſe were Converted beſides her ſelf.</p>

            <p>Firſt, <hi>Whether there be one</hi> Infant <hi>ſo much as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But we have</hi> Women <hi>expreſly mentioned to be of the</hi> Number <hi>of the</hi> 120 Diſciples, <hi>upon</hi> whom alſo <hi>the</hi> Spirit <hi>was</hi> poured <hi>in the day of</hi> Penticoſt, <hi>to</hi> whom <hi>the</hi> 3000 <hi>were</hi> joyned, <hi>and</hi> who together broke Bread <hi>alſo.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Are</hi> Children <hi>as expreſly owned to have</hi> right <hi>to</hi> Baptiſme, <hi>and enjoyned</hi> thereto, <hi>and capable to</hi> deſcern <hi>the</hi> ſpiritual Myſteries <hi>thereof, and to act</hi> Faith <hi>therein, being</hi> Believers, <hi>part of the</hi> Church, <hi>and</hi> Members <hi>of the</hi> Body <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>as</hi> Women <hi>are expreſly owned to have</hi> right <hi>to the</hi> Ordinance <hi>of the</hi> Supper? <hi>and enjoyned thereto, and capable to</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcern <hi>the</hi> ſpiritual Myſteries <hi>thereof, and to act</hi> Faith <hi>therein, as being</hi> Believers, <hi>part of the</hi> Church, <hi>and</hi> Members <hi>of the</hi> Body <hi>of</hi> Chriſt?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Is</hi> Infants Baptiſm <hi>acknowledged</hi> by us <hi>to be a</hi> known Truth, <hi>and that it is</hi> unpleaſant <hi>to us to</hi> raiſe Arguments againſt it, <hi>as you have in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs tearms done for</hi> Womens receiving the Lords Supper?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that here is not the leaſt paritie, or compariſon, to be made betwixt the one or the other, there being not the leaſt</hi> conſiderable <hi>pretence to imagine that any</hi> Infants <hi>were</hi> Baptized, <hi>becauſe tis ſaid that</hi> Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds were.</p>

            <p>Secondly, <hi>In the four</hi> Houſholds <hi>mentioned to be</hi> Baptized <hi>in Scripture, they are ſaid, at leaſt in three of them, if not in the fourth alſo, to comprehend</hi> only <hi>ſuch as were</hi> taught Believers; <hi>in thoſe</hi> Families <hi>or</hi> Houſholds.</p>

Mat.</hi> 28.9. Go teach, or <hi>Diſcipulize,</hi> all Nations, baptizing them, <hi>and that</hi> Children <hi>are</hi> Diſciples, <hi>is clear you ſay, from</hi> Act. 15.10. Why tempt you God, to put a Yoak upon the neck of the <hi>Diſciples?</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="187" facs="tcp:97512:97"/>
            <p>
               <hi>But for your better Information in Chriſts</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, <hi>I muſt refer you to the account Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>gives of it, who tells us the right Order thereof, and Leſſons therein,</hi> Viz. That the firſt task is to <hi>make Diſciples, which, he tells us,</hi> by <hi>Mark</hi> are called <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers.</hi> The ſecond is <hi>Baptize them.</hi> And the third to <hi>Teach them</hi> all other things which are afterwards to be learned in Chriſts Schoole; <hi>Which is a right and true definition of the Text: The Word,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>to</hi> Diſcipulize <hi>or make</hi> Diſciples, <hi>is nothing elſe but to beget them to the</hi> Faith, <hi>by</hi> preaching <hi>the</hi> Goſpel <hi>to them, the true means thereof, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> inſtructed <hi>in the</hi> Faith, <hi>they are to be</hi> Baptized <hi>therein. And therefore again, Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>truly tells us,</hi> That it is the conſtant Order, that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> follow <hi>Faith,</hi> and no better than an <hi>Impious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanation</hi> of the <hi>Sacrament</hi> if it go without <hi>Faith;</hi> And that if <hi>Faith</hi> be not the <hi>Pre-requiſite</hi> to <hi>Baptiſm Philip</hi> deluded and not decided the Queſtion, when he told the <hi>Eunuch,</hi> If he <hi>Believed</hi> with <hi>all</hi> his <hi>heart,</hi> he might. <hi>So that when you can make it appear your</hi> Infant, <hi>as a</hi> taught Diſciple, believes in Chriſt, <hi>you may find a</hi> Command <hi>here to</hi> Baptize him: <hi>Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, as Mr.</hi> Baxter <hi>tells us,</hi> Philips <hi>anſwer carries a</hi> Negative <hi>in it,</hi> viz. <hi>If thou doſt not</hi> believe, <hi>thou mayeſt not be</hi> baptized.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And as for</hi> Infants Diſcipleſhip, <hi>from</hi> Act. 15.10. <hi>It is an utter miſtake, the</hi> Diſciples <hi>there being thoſe</hi> Gentile Believers <hi>that had newly received the</hi> Faith, <hi>who were neither to be</hi> yoked <hi>with</hi> Circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>nor any other</hi> Jewiſh Rite, <hi>only they were</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned <hi>to abſtain from</hi> Idolathits, Blood, things Strangled <hi>and</hi> Fornication; <hi>there being no</hi> Infant
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:97512:98"/> 
               <hi>in the Caſe, nor concerned herein, neither are they any where called</hi> Believers <hi>or</hi> Diſciples.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Therefore, Sir, upon the whole, Let the Juditious</hi> Reader <hi>Judge betwixt us, whether you have given as good</hi> Ground, <hi>by as full</hi> Precept <hi>or</hi> Example <hi>for</hi> Baptizing Infants, <hi>as I have done from Gods Word for</hi> Womens Receiving the Lords Supper? <hi>Not doubting but this ſearch into this your Eſſay, will put a comfortable End to this part of the</hi> Controverſie <hi>betwixt us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>In the next place you muſt give me leave to return you an</hi> Anſwer <hi>to three or four ſmart</hi> Reflections <hi>I meet with in your</hi> Book.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Sir, I conceive you have given me juſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of</hi> Offence, <hi>ſo unduly to mention my not taking notice of Mr.</hi> Baxters Errata, <hi>without any the leaſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to what I have ſo largely ſpoke for his Satisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and my own Vindication, (having received the like meaſure from Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>therein alſo.) And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>proving that my</hi> Omiſſion <hi>with ſuch ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and wholly paſſing over thoſe Horrible things Remarkt by me (without Controle, as yet) out of Mr.</hi> Bs. Directory, <hi>ſavours not of too much</hi> Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality, <hi>is recommended to your better conſideration.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>No leſs infurious are you, and Mr.</hi> W. <hi>alſo, from the conſideration of thoſe</hi> Waldenſian Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions <hi>of</hi> Faith, <hi>where they aſſert</hi> Infants Baptiſm, <hi>to infer my mistaking of them in the whole, and to ſoyl all my other Testimonies in the Book, without taking the leaſt notice how I cited the late</hi> Confeſſions <hi>word for word, proving, they were not till their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in the ſixteenth Century, and that then other</hi> Confeſſions, <hi>cit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> by me, were in the twelveth Cent.</hi>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:97512:98"/> 400 <hi>years before; nor regarding what I Anſwer to every one of them, to which I muſt refer you, and to what I ſay to Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>for the like Diſingenuity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Sir, I have to blame you for a piece of unfairneſs, not to ſay unfaithfulneſs, reſpecting the</hi> Ritual <hi>part, where, to avoid the</hi> force <hi>of the Word</hi> Tabal, <hi>which the</hi> Septuagint <hi>renders by the</hi> Greek <hi>Word</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>and all our Tranſlators by the word</hi> Dip. <hi>You produce a Text,</hi> pag. 190, <hi>wherein (as you deal with it) you would neceſſitate another</hi> Interpretation <hi>to be put upon it,</hi> viz. Levit. 14.6. As for the living Bird, he ſhall take it and the Cedar-wood, and the Scarlet, and the Hyſop, and ſhall Dip them and the living in the blood of the Bird that was kill'd <hi>[there you ſtop, and leave out]</hi> over the running Water, <hi>nor taking any notice of what follows</hi> verſ. 51. <hi>And</hi> Dip them in the Blood of the ſlain Bird, and the running Water; <hi>But go on with your Inference, as though the</hi> running Water <hi>was not to be concerned in the Caſe, and ſay,</hi> Is it credible that the Bird that was killed did yeild ſo much blood that all thoſe things could be Dipped under it, and Covered with it? Certainly <hi>(ſay you)</hi> you muſt, at leaſt, run a Synechdoche here, or elſe you will make nothing of it. And if you do, and ſay a part of them only was Dipt, Why will you not at leaſt allow the ſame in <hi>Baptiſm?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But whether ſuch dealing with Gods Word comes not under a handling the Law</hi> partially, <hi>and dealling</hi> unfairly, <hi>not to ſay,</hi> deceitfully <hi>with it, is left to your own</hi> Conſcience to determine.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, <hi>I muſt endeavour to vindicate myſelf in another unhanſom</hi> Reflection, <hi>reſpecting an abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:97512:99"/> you charge upon me, and which I conceive will return upon your ſelf, and Partner too, with diſadvant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age, which is this. You are pleaſed Sir, in</hi> pag. 117. <hi>to tell me, in Anſwer to the beginning of my ſixth Chapter,</hi> That you muſt crave leave to tell me, that I miſs it in my Logick, in affirming the Right Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of Baptiſm (viz. <hi>a profeſſed Believer</hi>) to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the Matter and Eſſence of Baptiſm; <hi>and which Mr.</hi> Wills <hi>(in conjunction with you)</hi> carryes a little further, <hi>and tells me, in his uſual Stile,</hi> pag. 90. part 2. chap. 6. It is obſerveable, that he who hath undertaken to write a Treatiſe of Baptiſm, (<hi>Mark well,</hi> ſaith he) ſhould miſtake both the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form</hi> of it; for certainly he is out in both (<hi>and to be ſure Mr.</hi> W. <hi>will loſe nothing for want of Confidence, if that will carry it.</hi>) For the <hi>Matter, <hi>ſaith he,</hi>
               </hi> all Divines agree to be <hi>Water,</hi> and the <hi>Form,</hi> the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>Chriſt. For which he quotes</hi> Zanchy <hi>and</hi> Buchan.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>To which I ſay, as to the point of Logick (wherein I own little skill) in affirming, The Subject belongs to the</hi> Matter <hi>and</hi> Eſſence <hi>of Baptiſm, and that the true <hi>Form</hi> was <hi>Dipping,</hi> I conceive I am juſtified by the Learned. And as to the firſt, If</hi> Burgerdicius <hi>underſtood Logick, he tells us,</hi> That the Subject doth belong to the <hi>Matter,</hi> and is of the <hi>Eſſence</hi> thereof; <hi>Who divides the <hi>Matter</hi> into the</hi> Mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria ex qua, in qua; &amp; circa quam; <hi>of which, in which and about which;</hi> and that the two latter compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Subject</hi> or <hi>Object.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And agreeable hereto, we have the Learned</hi> Tilenus <hi>giving us the</hi> Logical <hi>Definition of Baptiſm, both as to <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> in his</hi> Syntag. Theol. Diſp.
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:97512:99"/> de Baptiſ. pag. 376. <hi>in theſe words. Firſt,</hi> That the <hi>Matter</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is two fold, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituens</hi> and <hi>Recipiens;</hi> the <hi>Conſtituens</hi> of two parts, <hi>viz. External</hi> and <hi>Elementary,</hi> viz. the <hi>Water. And</hi> Internal, the Spiritual thing ſignified. <hi>And the Recipiens,</hi> 
               <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, or Subject, <hi>is the</hi> fit Perſon <hi>that is to receive it. Secondly,</hi> That the <hi>Eſſential Form</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is nothing elſe but the <hi>Analogical</hi> Reaſon of the <hi>Signes</hi> to the <hi>Things ſignified.</hi> For as the property of Water in waſhing away the filth of the Fleſh, declares the force of Chriſts <hi>Blood</hi> in the waſhing away of Sin, So <hi>Diping</hi> in <hi>Water</hi> is a ſuitable <hi>Analogy</hi> of the <hi>Death</hi> of the <hi>Old Man;</hi> and coming up out of the <hi>Water,</hi> the <hi>Life</hi> of the <hi>New.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And in full agreement with him, the Learned</hi> Sir Norton Knatchbull <hi>in his</hi> Animad. pag. 317. <hi>tells us from</hi> Alexander Halyes, <hi>in theſe words, A</hi> io cum <hi>Alex.</hi> de <hi>Halys,</hi> Tinctio eſt <hi>formalis Cauſa Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi,</hi> &amp; ſi Tinctio, non Lotio, vel lavatio, vel ablutio; I ſay with <hi>Alexander</hi> de <hi>Halys,</hi> That <hi>Dipping</hi> is the <hi>formal Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Baptiſm;</hi> and if <hi>Diping,</hi> then not <hi>waſhing</hi> or <hi>pouring.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So that if theſe Learned Men are</hi> Right, <hi>you, my Reprovers, are</hi> Wrong, <hi>and deſerve blame and ſhame for your</hi> Raſhneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And further, that the right</hi> Subject, <hi>viz. a profeſt</hi> Believer <hi>is of the Eſſence of</hi> Baptiſm <hi>is manifeſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, if you may alter and change that, you may</hi> Baptize <hi>a</hi> Wall, <hi>or a</hi> Bell, <hi>a</hi> Sword, <hi>or a</hi> Standard, <hi>or what you will, and call it the</hi> Ordinance <hi>of</hi> Baptiſm. <hi>So that I am hereby the more confirmed, that if you miſs it in the</hi> Right Subject, <hi>or</hi> Matter <hi>of</hi> Baptiſm,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:97512:100"/> 
               <hi>viz. a</hi> Profeſt Believer, <hi>and erre alſo in the due</hi> Form <hi>or</hi> Ceremony, <hi>viz.</hi> Dipping, <hi>you have neither the <hi>Matter</hi> nor the <hi>Form</hi> of</hi> Baptiſm; <hi>and ſo, though you may call it</hi> Baptiſm, <hi>yet it is a meer</hi> Nullity, <hi>and no ſuch thing; concerning which, I refer you t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
